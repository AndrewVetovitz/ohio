            <p>Welcome to the website of High School I/O! High School I/O is the first high school hackathon hosted by
                OHI/O, a program created in 2013 with the goal of fostering a tech
                culture at Ohio State and its surrounding communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                We aim to provide high school students an opportunity to learn
                about computer science in a fun, engaging, and inclusive environment.
                Students will work in teams to build real technology projects. Students will
                also gain the opportunity to develop new friendships, build connections
                with professional mentors, and learn soft skills that will help them
                succeed in the real world.
            </p>

                    that brings together students with varying experience to create,
                    innovate, and build a project all within one day.
