		<br />
		<p>Welcome to the website of High School I/O! High School I/O is the first high school hackathon hosted by
			OHI/O, a program created in 2013 with the goal of fostering a tech
			culture at Ohio State and its surrounding communities.
		</p>
		<p>
			We aim to provide high school students an opportunity to learn
			about computer science in a fun, engaging, and inclusive environment.
			Students will work in teams to build real technology projects. Students will
			also gain the opportunity to develop new friendships, build connections
			with professional mentors, and learn soft skills that will help them
			succeed in the real world.
