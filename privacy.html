			<b>What information do we collect?</b>
			<br>
			OHI/O collects information from you when you fill out any voluntary forms we provide (event registration, surveys, etc.). Data from these forms is either kept internal to OHI/O, or is shared with our trusted sponsors and partners when specified (such as resumes from event registration being shared with the event's sponsors). Data is only shared with entities we trust and is never sold. Please refer to individual forms for details.
			<br><br>
			OHI/O also utilizes <a href="https://analytics.google.com/">Google Analytics</a> to compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. No personally identifying information is collected.
			<br><br>
			Any external websites we link to have their own separate and independent privacy policies; we have no responsibility or control over how these websites conduct themselves.
			<br><br>
			<b>California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</b>
			<br>
			We have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore do not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.
			<br><br>
			<b>Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</b>
			<br>
			We are in compliance with the requirements of COPPA (Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act), as we do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our website, products and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old or older.
