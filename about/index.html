			<h2>OHI/O's Mission</h2>
			<p>
				The OHI/O Program was created in 2013 with the goal of fostering a tech culture at Ohio State and its surrounding communities.
				The program has created Ohio State's first hackathon, as well as spin-off events including the hardware-focused Makeathon, ultimately providing students the opportunity to learn and build with real technologies outside of the classroom.
				OHI/O is a student driven, self sustaining platform that now runs Ohio's largest Hackathon, bringing together over 500+ students from various schools nationwide with the support of over 20 industry partners.
			</p>
			<h2>OHI/O History + Vision</h2>
			<p>
				The OHI/O program was founded with the goal of fostering a tech culture at Ohio State and its surrounding communities.
				In other words: to grow the excitement, the camaraderie, and access to resources for the thinkers, the makers, and the do-ers of OSU.
			</p>
			<p>
				Beginning with the university's first hackathon in 2013, the annual event has grown from 100 students in the library basement, to 200 students in 2014, and most recently to 500+ students in 17,389 sqft Ohio Union Ballroom.
				In addition to the flagship hackathon, the OHI/O platform introduced satellite events in 2014 hosting Ohio State's first hardware focused hackathon the Makeathon. In 2015, OHI/O sponsored Ohio State students to attend GiveBackHack, a local hackathon focused on social entrepreneurship. Through promoting and supporting additional tech events both on and off campus, such as TownHacks and DataFest, OHI/O aims enhance the student learning experience and engagement between students, community members, industry professionals, alumni and staff. 
			</p>
			<p>
				OHI/O emphasizes on providing students an informal and diverse learning platform regardless of experience or background. The OHI/O organizers possess a fundamental belief in the power of creation and are dedicated to empowering students to develop skills such as technical ability, communication, creativity, and critical thinking. Through the platform, OHI/O better connect students to real world problems and opportunities by engaging with the community and industry partners.
